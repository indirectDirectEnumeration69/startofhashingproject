# startofhashingproject
just learning some hash concepts and logic to hopefully one day turn this into a hash algorithm with a shit ton of refactoring going to be needed started 25th nov 2022.



Project wont be finished until unknown date , will probably integrate this idea into another project i find success in exploring.


- Need to also actually use proper hash functions instead of DIY'ing it , need to build off libs , also use LOKI and older hash alogrithms introduced into a 256 bit model or higher depending on computing power with new ideas of techniques i will think of and add and introduce into this project and others as i further myt understanding and gain better ideas and concepts by mini project ideas and "doodles" as ill call it.
